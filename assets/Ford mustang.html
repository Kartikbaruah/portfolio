                The Ford Mustang GT is a high-performance version of the Ford Mustang, which was first introduced in 1965. 
                The Mustang GT has had several generations and the GT badge has had different meanings throughout the years:
                First generation (1965–1973)
                The first Mustang GTs had V8 engines and sportier suspension. 
                The GT badge started as a $165 package in 1965 and the Mustang GT was Steve McQueen's hero car in the 1968 film Bullitt.
                Second generation (1974–1978)
                Performance declined during this era due to the oil crisis and stricter emission regulations.
                Third generation (1979–1993)
                The Fox-body Mustang era saw a return to performance with the Mustang GT. 
                In the 1980s, the 5.0 Mustang GT was popular with Vanilla Ice.
